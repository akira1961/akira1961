My name is Akira MORI.

I've been making various programs since I made a calculation simulation of falling objects (using assembler) on a Z80 microcomputer in 1982.

Recently, I've been making API extension programs for OPU UI (using C++) 
and program generation programs for NC (using C#).

I'm good at making simple on-premise tools from simple handwritten specifications.
